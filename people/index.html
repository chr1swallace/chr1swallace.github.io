<p>I am a statistician who works with biological datasets to understand
the mechanisms underlying human immune-mediated diseases and identify possible
treatments.<br />
<!-- Such work is only possible with close collaboration with -->
<!-- biologists, and I maintain close collaborations with moved to the [Cambridge -->
<!-- Institute for Medical Research](http://www.cimr.cam.ac.uk) in 2009 to pursue these -->
<!-- collaborations, most closely with the [Diabetes and Inflammation -->
<!-- Laboratory](http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk).   -->
During
the GWAS era, we, and others, identified many genetic polymorphisms
that alter risk of human immune mediated diseases such as type 1 diabetes and
rheumatoid arthritis.  I now follow up this research in three directions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>jointly analysing multiple immune-mediated diseases/traits to borrow information between them and understand shared and distinct components of risk</li>
  <li>identifying the cell specific mechanisms through which these variants affect disease risk</li>
  <li>understanding how the immune system is dysregulated in disease, and how this may be modulated</li>
</ol>

<p>Statistically, my current work is focused on variable selection, horizontal integration, clustering, Bayesian model averaging and empirical Bayes false discovery rates, and matrix factorisation, applied to integrated analysis of multiple related genetic and genomic datasets. How we do research is also important, and I am focused on valuing the people who do research and developing better open science practices.</p>

<!-- My aim for my group is that, by integrating detailed biological understanding with principled statistical inference we will make a meaningful contribution to the understanding of immune mediated diseases. -->

<!-- In Feburary 2016 I moved to  as a PI with the aim of establishing new collaborations. -->
<p>I am funded by the <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</a> as a Senior Research Fellow, Director of Research and PI in the  <a href="http://www.med.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Medicine</a> (University of Cambridge) and hold a Programme Leader  position  at the <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/">MRC Biostatistics Unit</a>.  I am a member of the MRC funded stratified medicine programme <a href="https://www.clusterconsortium.org.uk/">CLUSTER</a>, working with partners at GOSH, QMUL, Manchester, and Liverpool on childhood arthritis.</p>

<p>Since 2022, I have also held a part time position in GSK, which allows me to learn how genomics research can be used to impact decisions in target discovery, and perhaps make some of that impact myself.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/people/mdf34/">Mary Fortune</a>  worked as a Wellcome Trust PhD student in the <a href="http://cato.medschl.cam.ac.uk/graduate-programmes/phd-programmes/wellcome-trust-mathematical-genomics-and-medicine-mgm/">Mathematical Genomics and Medicine</a> programme on colocalisation analysis in dependent datasets and methods for fitting models of genetic causality to summary GWAS data. She stayed on in the group to complete papers arising from her PhD work and has now moved to the <a href="http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk">MRC Biostatistics Unit</a>.</p>

<p>Lucia did her BSc in Mathematics at the University of Newcastle Upon
Tyne and her MPhil in Computational Biology at
Cambridge University. She did her summer project in the Wallace group on
eQTL-GWAS colocalisation analysis to identify causal genes for Type 1
Diabetes. She is now studying for a PhD in Epidemiology at
Imperial College London.</p>

<p>Hui worked as a post doctoral researcher on gene expression data, and led the analysis of our study relating gene expression in PBMCs from children at risk of type 1 diabetes to autoantibody positivity.  She is now a lecturer in biostatistics at <a href="http://www.population-health.manchester.ac.uk/staff/HuiGuo/">University of Manchester</a>.</p>

  <p>Xin’s PhD focused on analysis of all kinds of next gen sequencing data - pooled DNA, RNA
seq, and bisulfite seq.  She had a special interest in modelling the extra binomial
variation induced by pooling.</p>
