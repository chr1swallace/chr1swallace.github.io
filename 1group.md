I am a statistician who works with biological datasets to understand
the mechanisms underlying human immune-mediated diseases and identify possible
treatments.  
<!-- Such work is only possible with close collaboration with -->
<!-- biologists, and I maintain close collaborations with moved to the [Cambridge -->
<!-- Institute for Medical Research](http://www.cimr.cam.ac.uk) in 2009 to pursue these -->
<!-- collaborations, most closely with the [Diabetes and Inflammation -->
<!-- Laboratory](http://www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk).   -->
During
the GWAS era, we, and others, identified many genetic polymorphisms
that alter risk of human immune mediated diseases such as type 1 diabetes and
rheumatoid arthritis.  I now follow up this research in three directions:
1. jointly analysing multiple immune-mediated diseases/traits to borrow information between them and understand shared and distinct components of risk
2. identifying the cell specific mechanisms through which these variants affect disease risk
3. understanding how the immune system is dysregulated in disease, and how this may be modulated

Statistically, my current work is focused on variable
selection, Bayesian model averaging and empirical Bayes false
discovery rates, and matrix factorisation, applied to integrated analysis of multiple related genetic and genomic
datasets.

<!-- My aim for my group is that, by integrating detailed biological understanding with principled statistical inference we will make a meaningful contribution to the understanding of immune mediated diseases. -->

<!-- In Feburary 2016 I moved to  as a PI with the aim of establishing new collaborations. --> I am funded by the [Wellcome Trust](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) as a Director of Research and PI in the  [Department of Medicine](http://www.med.cam.ac.uk/) (University of Cambridge) and hold an honorary Programme Leader  position  at the [MRC Biostatistics Unit](http://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/).  I am a member of the MRC funded stratified medicine programme [CLUSTER](https://www.clusterconsortium.org.uk/), working with partners at GOSH, QMUL, Manchester, and Liverpool on childhood arthritis.
