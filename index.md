Our immune system protects us against infectious disease, but
sometimes attacks our own cells, causing disease.  My group
develop and apply statistical genomic methods to understand
the genes, cells and pathways involved in the development of immune-mediated
diseases such as type 1 diabetes and the relationships between
different immune-mediated diseases.  Our goal is to further the
understanding of these diseases in order to help prevent and treat
them.
